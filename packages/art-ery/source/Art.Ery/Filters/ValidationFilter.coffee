TODO!!!
# BUG: ValidationFilter doesn't validated the TimestampFilter's fields! (when using createDatabaseFilters)
# PROBLEM: ValidationFilter only validates the fields it is passed.
# SOLUTION: we need it to always validate all fields declared for the pipeline.
# createDatabaseFilters needs to change order: it needs to run ValidationFilter last.

I almost want to rename this "FieldTypesFilter" - since it both validates and preprocesses.
It should actually also have an @after pass that at least converts timestamps back into Dates.
