# ArtSuite: [ZEN](http://www.essenceandartifact.com/2016/02/yagni-and-building-in-house-frameworks.html) Apps for Web and Mobile

If your website has a login, has any dynamically generated web pages, or otherwise has a non-trivial amount of code, you are writing an app, not a collection of documents. HTML is an [flying-submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_submarine). I.e, it's trying to do two things at the same time which are fundamentally different: be a document format and an app framework. It is impossible to do both those things well at the same time, and HTML proves the point. Further, HTML is biased towards documents over apps.

Enter Art.Suite, a web framework written from the ground up for apps, without HTML.

### What is the Art.Suite?

A collection of tools with two main goals:

1. One platform for Cloud-Enabled Apps across Web, Mobile-Web and 'native' Apps.
2. Maximize developer productivity.

Sub goals include:

* designer-oriented
* minimize code (measured in tokens)
* maximum extensibility at all levels
* built on ubiquitous standards (Javascript and HTMLCanvas)
