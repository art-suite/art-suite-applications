# Art-Suite: ArtModels

ArtModels are a simple, elegant solution to the following design problems:

- (ArtReact or React) Components can subscribe to remote or shared data
- Subscribing Components' states are automatically updated:
  - if the status of the initial request changes
  - as the initial request makes progress
  - whenever the data changes
- If the data is available immediately upon component instantiation, the componentâ€™s first render will reflect that data.
- Data is addressed by model-name and key-string.
  - Non-string keys are supported via custom `dataToKeyString` or `toKeyString` methods.
- Model and subscription definitions are simple and lean.
- Mutations are available as simple functions attached to each model.

## How It Works

There are two main parts to ArtModels, and the Store:

Using ArtModels consists of registering one or more ArtModels and then subscribe to data provided by those models.

Behind the scenes, the Store, a singleton class, manages all component subscriptions and provides epoch state updates. Epoch state updates queue all state changes in ArtModels turing a time unit, usually one animation frame, and  applies them atomically to the Store's internal state. Immediately after the internal state update, Store notifies all subscribers of changes.

New subscriptions to data not currently in the Store indirectly cause loads to be invoked on the appropriate models. ArtModels are responsible for updating the Store on the progress of those loads and the final result. ArtModels can later update the Store if that data is updated locally or remotely.

When all subscribers to a particular piece of data go away, the Store releases the data. In this way the Store only keeps in memory what is actually being used by active subscribers. Using the ModelSubscribersMixin makes tracking active subscribers easy.

The diagram above shows typical method invocations that cause data to flow around the data-flow loop. Only the `myModel.myMutator` needs to be invoked in your application code. Subscribers are automatically updated, and standard ArtModels take care of updating the Store for you.

# Example

To use ArtModels, create your a custom model and custom Component with a subscription to the model:

```coffeescript
# models/nav_state.caf
import &@ArtModels

class NavState extends ApplicationState
  @stateFields currentTab: :home

  nextTab: ->
    @currentTab =
      switch @currentTab
      when :home then :search
      else :home
```

```coffeescript
# components/my_component.caf
import &@ArtModels

# class Component
#   setState: (key, value) -> ...

class UserView extends ModelSubscriptionsMixin Component
  @subscriptions :navState.currentTab
```

# Subscription Declarations

@subscriptions takes an object as input with each entry describing one subscription.

A subscription consists of 3 parts:

* stateField:   the field in @state which will be set with the subscribed-to data
* model:        the subscribed-to model (from the ModelRegistry)
* key:          key for the specific, subscribed-to data in the model

There are many different ways to define the subscription, shown below.

### Subscription Declarations, Object Forms

### Fully Explicit

```coffeescript
  @subscriptions
    stateField:
      model: "modelName", model-instance or (props) -> "modelName"
      key:   "key",       key-object     or (props) -> "key" or key-object
```

### Model-name == StateField-name with Explicit, Constant Key

```coffeescript
@subscriptions
  stateField: constantKey
```

is equivalent to:

```coffeescript
@subscriptions
  stateField:
    model:  'stateField'
    key:    constantKey
```

### Model-name == StateField-name with Key-Function

```coffeescript
@subscriptions
  stateField: (props) -> # return key
```

is equivalent to:

```coffeescript
@subscriptions
  stateField:
    model:  'stateField'
    key:    (props) -> # return key
```

Example:

```coffeescript
@subscriptions
  user: (props) -> props.userId

# Or, using coffeescript shorthand:
@subscriptions
  user: ({userId}) -> userId
```

### Subscription Declarations, String Forms

In addition to declaring subscriptions with object-notation, you can also use a simple string for common subscription-types. A subscription-string can contain one or more subscription declarations separated by spaces or commas.

### Model Form

This form is useful for subscribing to a single record from a table. This pattern works best if you follow the [[ArtModels Conventions]].

```coffeescript
@subscriptions "myField"
```

is equivalent to:

```coffeescript
@subscriptions
  myField:
    model:  'myField'
    key:    ({myField, myFieldId}) -> myField?.id || myFieldId
```

Example:

```coffeescript
@subscriptions "post"

#is short for:
@subscriptions
  post:
    model:  "post"
    key:    ({post, postId}) -> post?.id || postId
```

### Model.Key form

This form is useful for subscribing to a specific, known key. In particularly, this works well with ApplicationState models.

```coffeescript
@subscriptions "modelName.fieldName"
```

is equivalent to:

```coffeescript
@subscriptions
  fieldName:
    key: fieldName
    model: modelName
```

### Model-By form

### Key functions

If the key or model is a function, the function:

* is executed without @ set
* inputs: (props) - the component
* outputs: key or modelName respectively

```coffeescript
###
IN: props is the component instance's @props
@/THIS: not set
OUT: key
###
(props) -> key
```

Key-functions are called initially during getInitialState to set up initial
subscriptions.

If the key-function returns null, all dependent state fields will be set to
null. No other action will be taken.

Whenever @props changes (e.g. when componentWillReceiveProps is called), these
key-functions are re-evaluated. If the return value changes, subscriptions are
updated and new data is requested where needed.

# Model Subscriptions

Declaring a subscription in an object extending ModelSubscriptionsMixin has a few important effects. For a given subscription with a state-field name 'myStatefield':

* defines the getter: `@myStatefield`
* sets multiple fields on @state:
  * @state.myStateField - the current value from the subscription or null if no value has been fetched
  * @state.myStateFieldStatus - (string) the current status of fetching the value for the subscription (see Art.Founcation.ConnectionStatus)
  * @state.myStateFieldProgress - (number between 0 and 1) the current progress fetching the value for the subscription

Example
```coffeescript
class UserView extends ModelSubscriptionsMixin Object
  @subscriptions "user"

  render: ->
    TextElement
      text: @user?.name || @state.userStatus

```

# ArtModels Conventions

* model-names which represent tables of records should be singular. Examples:
  - user
  - post
  - comment
* Keys for records are called "ids." When passing an id as a prop to a component, name it the model-name plus 'Id'. Examples:
  - userId
  - postId
  - commentId

If you follow these patterns, your subscription declarations are nice and concise. Example:

```coffeescript
class UserView extends ModelSubscriptionsMixin Object
  @subscriptions :user :post
```

By default, the name of the subscription-field is used to find the model, and the model's `propsToKey`
function is used to extract the key from props. It's equivalent to:

```coffeescript
class UserView extends ModelSubscriptionsMixin Object
  @subscriptions
    user:
      model:  :user
      key:    ({user, userId}) -> user?.id || userId

    post:
      model:  :user
      key:    ({post, postId}) -> post?.id || postId
```
