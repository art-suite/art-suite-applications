# nearInfinity NOTES:
# http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/v8/
# Chrome uses signed 31bit integers for "optimized ints"; this is the largest optimized integer value:
#   Math.pow(2, 30) - 1
# However, its nice to have a round number to make it clear it is a special number.
# We don't use Inifinity because Infinity * 0 is NaN - we want it to be 0.

# On further reflection, these numbers are going to be floating-point anyway, so lets make them big.
