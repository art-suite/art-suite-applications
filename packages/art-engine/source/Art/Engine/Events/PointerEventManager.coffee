PointerEventManager

All Event Types:
  pointerCancel
  pointerMove
  pointerUp
  pointerDown
  mouseMove
  mouseIn
  mouseOut
  focus
  blur

  pointerClick
  pointerUpInside
  pointerUpOutside
  pointerIn
  pointerOut

Keyboard events are routed through the PointerEventManager.
  Keyboard Event types:
    keyDown
    keyUp
    keyPress

  see KeyEvent for details on the event

TODO:
  Rename these events:

    mouseMove => cursorMove
    mouseIn   => cursorMoveIn
    mouseOut  => cursorMoveOut

DESIGN NOTES
Purpose:
  Support Touch and Mouse events.
  Support a common set of events for the subset of Touch and Mouse semantics that overlap:
    single-touch / single-mouse-button-down

  Synthesize events:
    pointerClick
      triggered if active-locations went from 0 to non-0 and back to 0 without moving outside the pointerDeadZone
    pointerUpInside / pointerUpOutside
      just before the pointerUp event is sent:
        if pointer is "pointInside" for the target element
          send pointerUpInside
        else
          send pointerUpOutside
    pointerIn / pointerOut
      pointer's "pointInside" changed from false>>true for the target element
        send pointerMovedIn
      else
        send pointerMovedOut

Differences between Touch events and Mouse events
  Touch Events
    can have 0 or more "active" locations. Does not have "inactive" locations.
    locations can be added or removed. A removed location is not "re-added", only "new" locations are added.
  Mouse Events
    can have 1 active or 1 "inactive" location
    the "active" location has state:
      what mouse buttons are down

EVENT ORDER
  Parents get events before children.
  If a parent captures a pointer during an event, children will NOT see the event.

TODO
  updateMousePath should be called anytime Elements are added, removed or any other change that might effect the mousePath

HOW IT WORKS
  pointerDown, pointerUp and pointerMove events all happen when a pointer is being ACTIVE:
    touchs are always "active"
    mouse is "active" if one or more buttons are down (currently only left button is supported)

  multi-touch:
    Each active touch sends its own events. Ex:
      these sequence of real-world events:
        index-finger-touch-start
        middle-finger-touch-start
        hand-moves-and-so-do-both-fingers
        remove-all-fingers
      results in an event sequence like this:
        touch_down id: 7
        touch_down id: 3
        touch_move id: 7
        touch_move id: 3
        touch_up   id: 7
        touch_down id: 3

      NOTE: the ids are abitrary, but consistent across events for a touch sequence
      NOTE: Because of this, if you listen to "pointerMove" without inspecting the pointer's id,
        you might get more move events than you are expecting.

  mouseMove is sent every time the mouse moves regardless of button status
    NOTE: mouseMove is never sent on a touch device.

GUARANTEES
  All pointer movement will send mouseMove events!
    This isn't true with the raw DOM events. Mouse-Pointer up/down and touchEnd can all show locations different from the last move event.
    This means:
      On desktop, if you are tracking "null" move events (inactive pointer), then you'll be up-to-date with the pointer-location when a click happens.
      On either desktop or touch devices, if you are tracking move events, the pointer's location won't have changed between the last mouseMove event and the pointerUp event.

  SBD NOTE 2016: This method of sorting priority is global and breaks "parents encapsulate children".
  Breaking that rule makes Elements/Components less modular. A Component (subranch of the AIM tree) could
  move within the tree and have its own behavior or the behavior of ancesors change unpredictably.

  Is there a better way??? We need to better understand the use-cases. Mostly it has to do with gestures.
  Sometimes we want the child to have a chance to capture a gesture first, if it decides to, and then let
  the parent have a default gesture if the child declines.

  Old Idea: allow the parent to invert its own priority. It can set itself to have lower priority than its children.
    This meets the encapsulation requirement.
    It does limit us to only putting the parent before all children or after all children for events.
      Do we need a way to put a parent in the middle of its children event-wise?

  2016 May Idea: Use a similar system to the one I'm putting in place today for KeyboardEvents:
    Change pointerEventPriority to be one of:
      beforeAncestors:
      beforeDescendents:
      beforeChildren: (default)
      afterChildren

    OR a function which takes: (pointerEventType, pointer) -> and returns one of the above values.

    If we implement it as a recursive function, it looks like this:


      add = (index) ->

      recurse = (startIndexInclusive, endIndexExclusive) ->
        firstBeforeDescendentsIndex = -1
        firstBeforeAncestorsIndex = -1
        lastBeforeAncestorsIndex = -1

        for i in [startIndexInclusive...endIndexExclusive] by 1
          priority = elementPriorities[i]
          switch priority
            when "beforeDescendents" then firstBeforeDescendentsIndex = i if firstBeforeDescendentsIndex < 0
            when "beforeAncestors"
              firstBeforeAncestorsIndex = i if firstBeforeAncestorsIndex < 0
              lastBeforeAncestorsIndex = i

        if firstBeforeDescendentsIndex >= 0 && firstBeforeDescendentsIndex < firstBeforeAncestorsIndex
          recurse startIndexInclusive, firstBeforeDescendentsIndex
          add firstBeforeDescendentsIndex
          recurse firstBeforeDescendentsIndex + 1, endIndexExclusive

        else if lastBeforeAncestorsIndex >= 0
          add lastBeforeAncestorsIndex
          recurse lastBeforeAncestorsIndex + 1, endIndexExclusive

  queueKeyEvents

  NOTE: @_currentFocusPath is sorted ancestors first.

  All elements in @_currentFocusPath potentially can receive the event.

  To generate the exact elementsToSendEventTo list, we need to call
  @willConsumeKeyboardEvent() on all elements in @_currentFocusPath.

  Basic:
    Send the event to each element in @_currentFocusPath in order until one returns "beforeDescendents"
  Unless:
    If any return "beforeAncestors", only send the event to the very last one that returns "beforeAncestors"
