React.js vs ReactArtEngine
--------------------------

Generaly, ReactArtEngine is designed to work just like React.js. There is
some evolution, though, which I try to note below. -SBD

ReactArtEngine: "Instantiation"
-------------------------------

This is not a concept in React.js. It isn't important to the client, but it
is useful to understand in the implementation.

In-short: a non-instantiated component only has properties. It doesn't have
state and it isn't rendered. An instantiated component has state and gets
rendered at least once.

When a component is used in a render function, and with every re-render,
an instance-object is created with standard javascript "new ComponentType."
However, that component instance is only a shell - it contains the
properties passed into the constructor and nothing else.

Once the entire render is done, the result is diffed against the current
Virtual-AIM. The component instance is compared against existing components
via the diff rules. If an existing, matching component exists, that
component is updated and the new instance is discard. However, if an
existing match doesn't exist, then the new component instance is
"instantiated" and added to the virtual-Aim.

QUESTIONS
---------

I just discovered it is possible, and useful, for a component to be rendered
after it is unmounted. I don't think this is consistent with Facebook-React.

Possible: if @setState is called after it is unmounted, it will trigger a
render. This can happen in FluxComponents when a subscription updates.

Useful: Why does this even make sense? Well, with Art.Engine we have
removedAnimations. That means the element still exists even though it has been
"removed." It exists until the animation completes. It is therefor useful to
continue to receive updates from React, where appropriate, during that "sunset"
time.

Thoughts: I think this is OK, though this changes what "unmounted" means. I just
fixed a bug where @state got altered without going through preprocessState first
when state changes after the component was unmounted. How should I TEST this???

  Function:     preprocessProps

  When:         Called on component instantiation and any time props are updated

  IN:           newProps - The props received from the render call which created/updated this component

  OUT:          plain Object - becomes @props. Can be newProps, based on newProps or entirely new.

  Guarantee:    @props will allways be passed through preprocessProps before it is set.
                i.e. Your render code will never see a @props that hasen't been preprocessed.

  Be sure your preprocessProps: (requirements)
    - returns a plain Object
    - doesn't modify the newProps object passed in (create and return new object to add/alter props)
    - call super!

  Examples:
    # minimal
    preprocessProps: ->
      merge super, myProp: 123

    # a little of everything
    preprocessProps: ->
      newProps = super
      @setState foo: newProps.foo
      merge newProps, myProp: "dude: #{newProps.foo}"

  Okay:
    you can call @setState (Art.Flux.Component does exactly this!)

  Description:
    Either return exactly newProps which were passed in OR create a new, plain object.
    The returned object can contain anything you want.
    These are the props the component will see in any subsequent lifecycle calls.

  NOTE: Unique to Art.React. Not in Facebook's React.

  NOTES RE Facebook.React:
    Why add this? Well, often you want to apply a transformation to @props whenever its set OR it changes.
    With Facebook.React there is no one lifecycle place for this. Component instantiation/mounting
    and component updating are kept separate. I have found it is very error-prone to implement
    this common functionality manually on each component that needs it.

  Function:     preprocessState

  When:         preprocessState is called:
                  immediatly after getInitialState
                  after preprocessProps
                  after componentWillUpdate
                  before rendering

  IN:           newState - the state which is proposed to become @state
  OUT:          object which will become @state. Can be newState, be based on newState or completely new.

  Guarantees:   @state will allways be passed through preprocessState before it is set.
                i.e. Your render code will never see a @state that hasen't been preprocessed.

  NOTES RE Facebook.React:
    Why add this? Well, often you want to apply a transformation to @state whenever it is initialized
    OR it changes. With Facebook.React there is no one lifecycle place for this. Component
    instantiation/mounting and component updating are kept separate. I have found it is very
    error-prone to implement this common functionality manually on each component that needs it.

    An example of this is FluxComponents. They alter state implicitly as the subscription data comes in, and
    and component instantiation. preprocessState makes it easy to transform any data written via FluxComponents
    into a standard form.

  SBD NOTES TO SELF:
    I think:
      - it is OK to directly mutate newState, can we declare this offically part of the API?
      - calls to @setState in preprocessState will be applied NEXT epoch.
      - could make getInitialState obsolete, but I think we'll keep it around for convenience and consistency

    2016-12: I can't decide! Should we allow state updates on unmounted components or not?!?!
    RELVANCE: allowing state updates allows us to update animating-out Art.Engine Elements.
    This is useful, for example, to hide the TextInput Dom element

    I'm generally against updating unmounted components:
      - they don't get new props. Logically, since they are unmounted,
        they should have no props, yet they do. They would surely
        completely break if we set @props = {}.

      - Since they don't get new @props, there is no way for the parent-before-unmounting
        to control unmounted Components. If their state can change, their parent-before
        should have some control.

    BUT, we need a better answer for animating-out Components. There is a need for re-rendering them
    at the beginning and ending of their animating-out process.

    Animating-Out
      - Most things can probably be handled by 1 render just before animating-out starts. This
        is awkward to do manually: First render decides we are going to remove a sub-component, but
        doesn't - during that render - instead it tells that component it is about to be animated-out.
        Then, it queues another render where it actually removes the sub-component. And this must all
        be managed by the parent Component, when really it's 100% the child-component's concern.

      - What if a Component can request a "final render" just BEFORE it is unmounted? The parent Component's
        render runs, removing the child Component. Then ArtReact detects the child needs unmounting, but just
        before it unmounts it, the child gets a re-render as-if it's props changed, though they didn't. This
        in turn will update any Element or child Components for their animating-out state. After that,
        the component will get no more renders - since it will then be unmounted and unmounted components don't
        get rendered.

      - Further, when we do this final render, we can signal it is "final" via @props.
        - have the component get a final-render notification (via a member function override).
          That function takes as inputs the last-good @props, and returns the final-render @props.
          If it returns null, there will be no final render. This is the default implementation.

        - I LIKE!

      - Conclusion: New Component override: (TODO - I think we should go for this solution!)

          finalRenderProps: (previousProps) -> null

        To request a final-render, all you need to do is add this to your Component:

          finalRenderProps: (previousProps) -> previousProps

        And you may find it handy to also do:

          finalRenderProps: (previousProps) -> merge previousProps, finalRender: true

        Then you can do something special for your final-render:

          render: ->
            {finalRender} = @props

            if finalRender ...

    DO WE NEED SOMETHING MORE POWERFUL?

      - Do we need more than 1 "final render" - during animating-out?
      - Do we need an animating-out-done render?
      - A general solution would be a "manual unmount" option. I don't love this, but
        I also don't love tying this explicitly to ArtEngine's animating-out features.

  Clears out @_pendingUpdates and @_pendingState, applying them all to 'state' as passed-in.

  NOTE:
    This is a noop if @_pendingUpdates and @_pendingState are null.
    OldState is returned without any work done.

  ASSUMPTIONS:
    if @_pendingState is set, it is an object we are allowed to mutate
      It will be mutated and be the return-value of this function.

  IN:
    oldState - the state to update

  EFFECTS:
    oldState is NOT modified
    @_pendingState and @_pendingUpdates are null and have been applied to oldState

  OUT: state is returned as-is unless @_pendingState or @_pendingUpdates is set
  ###
  _resolvePendingUpdates: (oldState = @state)->
    if @_pendingState
      newState = mergeIntoUnless @_pendingState, oldState

      for updateFunction in @_pendingUpdates
        newState = updateFunction.call @, newState

      @_pendingUpdates = null

    newState ? oldState

  NOTES:
    - newProps is non-null if this component is being updated from a non-instantiated Component.
    - This is where @props gets set for any update, but not where it gets set for component initializiation.

    ###
    React.js forbids calling setState from componentWillUpdate, but I see no reason for this.
    This next line safely supports state updates in componentWillUpdate in a pure-functionalish way:
      after a setState in @componentWillUpdate,
      the new state will not be visible in the remainder of that @componetWillUpdate call
      but it will be visible in any subsquent lifecycle call such as @render

    NOTES:
      @_resolvePendingUpdates is used here to immeidately apply any changes @_componentDidUpdate
        caused. However, if it didn't cause any changes, it's a noop.
        Performance FYI: If @_componentDidUpdate triggers any changes, one new object will be created.

      @_epochUpdateQueued is cleared AFTER @_componentDidUpdate so calles to @setState won't
        actually trigger an epoch.
    ###
    newState = @_resolvePendingUpdates newState
    @_epochUpdateQueued = false

    # SAVE THE CHANGES NOW!
    @props = newProps

    # NOTE: Any updates state-changes triggered in @preprocessState will be delayed until next epoch
    # NOTE: @_preprocessState assumes @props has already been updated
    @state = @_preprocessState newState
