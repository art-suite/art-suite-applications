# KeyFieldsMixin = require './KeyFieldsMixin'
# TODO - add KeyFieldsMixin
# PURPOSE: allow multi-key queries to be defined using KeyFieldsMixin's
#   awesome implementation: @primaryKey 'topicId/postOrder'
#   The problem is KeyFieldsMixin's configuration is 100% at the class level,
#   but here, every instance of PipelineQuery needs it's own key-fields config.
#   It needs to be initializable in the instance and via the constructor, hopefully
#   via setters so we don't need to touch the constructor below.
#   A valid query declaration could be: query: (->), primareyKey: 'topicId/PostOrder'
#   And that's it. Art.Ery request keys would look like: {topicId, postOrder}
# STRATEGY: Can we just use @extendableProperty?
#   Do we need the ES6 extendableProperty?
#     I don't think so. The new ES5 extendableProperty defines a setter-extended for instacnes.
#     It just isn't available at the class-level yet, but that's OK for this purpose.
# PROBLEM: There is one further problem, query-request are attached to the singleton pipeline,
#   and key encoding is declared for all requests in the singleton pipeline in the pipeline's class.
#   Clearly we'd need to override key encoding for specific query-request types. Should be doable...
